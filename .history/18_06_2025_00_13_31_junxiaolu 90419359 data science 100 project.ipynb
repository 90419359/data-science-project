    "### Background: \n",
    "Video games are a popular way for people to play and connect with others. Game makers and researchers often use newsletters to share updates, events, or news with players. But not every player signs up for these newsletters. If we can find out which players are more likely to subscribe, we can better understand what kinds of players are more interested and involved.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this project, we look at real data from a Minecraft research server. The data includes player information and how they behave in the game. We want to find out which player features and behaviors are most useful in predicting whether someone will subscribe to the newsletter. This can help game teams and researchers plan better ways to reach the right players.\n",

    "Can a player’s gender predict whether they will subscribe to a game-related newsletter, and does this pattern differ across experience levels?\n",
    "\n",
    "This project explores whether gender affects a player’s likelihood to subscribe. The response variable is subscribe (TRUE or FALSE), and the explanatory variable is gender. Using data from players.csv, we will compare subscription rates across different genders.The goal is to build a simple model to see if gender helps predict subscription behavior.\n",
    "### Data Description:\n",
    "## 1.players.csv\n",
    "Each row in this dataset represents an individual player. The columns include:\n",

    "    subscribe: Indicating whether the player subscribed to the server’s content or notifications.\n",

    "    hashedEmail: A pseudonymized identifier for each player.\n",
    "\t\n",
    "    played_hours: Total number of hours the player has played on the server.\n",

    "    name: The first name of the player.\n",

    "    gender: Gender identity (Male, Female, Non-binary).\n",
